# Caldera

A caldera `(/kɔːlˈdɛrə, kæl-/[1] kawl-DERR-ə, kal-)` is a large cauldron-like hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber in a volcano eruption.

The Yellowstone Caldera, sometimes referred to as the Yellowstone Supervolcano, is a volcanic caldera and supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park in the Western United States.

## Design system

The Caldera project is intended to be the canonical repository of the [style dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) files that represent the design system as defined by the ONX design team.

## Changes

Changes to the design system can be published by creating a new release.

All releases must adhere to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention.

This allows all clients to adopt a specific version, each with a well defined set of changes, and empowers the design team to decide when to publish a new version.

## Client adoption

The intent is that any and all clients can utilize the published style dictionary files using the best approach for heir respective platforms.

### Android

TBD

### iOS (swift)

Caldera provides a simple swift package that can be used by iOS via the [swift package manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). The [Yellowstone](https://github.com/onXmaps/ios-yellowstone) package includes it as a dependency, providing access to the design library themes and components for swift applications.

### Web
